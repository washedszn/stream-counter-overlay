# Stream counter overlay
Keep track of wins and losses though your stream deck 

## Setup

1. Download the zip of repository (Click the green "Code" button and then click "Download ZIP")
2. Unzip the file
3. Open stream deck (alternatively you could set any macro to run the .bat files)
4. On stream deck create an "Open" action for wins, losses and reset
5. For each action you need to enter the file path of the .bat file, for example -> wins button = `C:\Users\user\Downloads\counter-overlay\wins_script.bat`
7. Now you can simply add a text file overlay on OBS (or other streaming software) using the `final.txt` file
